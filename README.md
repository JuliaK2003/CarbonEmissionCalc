# CO2 Emissions Calculator with Graph 
This project allows users to calculate their CO2 emissionsn based on their distance travelled and their mode of transport.
Users can input start and end addresses, as well as select a mode of transportation (Car, Bus, or Bike) and will get an estimate of their emissions. A graph comparing the user's emissions to the 
average Canadian's emissions per commute will be displayed.

#Features
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculates the distance between two addresses using the Nominatim API.
- **CO2 Emissions Estimation**: Estimates the CO2 emissions based on the selected transportation method.
- **Bar Graph Visualization**: A bar chart compares the user's emissions with the average emissions.
- **Responsive Interface**: The interface adjusts to fit different screen sizes and is simple to use.
